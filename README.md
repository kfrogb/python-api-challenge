Repo to hold files for Module 6 (python-API-challenge)

Project Title: Python-API-Challenge

Project Description: Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Use the weather data skills to plan future vacations.

Using Code: Use code in Terminal in conjunction Python and various API's to run scripts.

How to Use Project: Use the WeatherPY code to calculate stats for a set of random cities which will bring back temperatures, humidity, cloudiness, and wind statistics that will be analyzed. Then the CSV file produced by the WeatherPY file will be used to analyzie various vacation statistics to filter down to only those that fit within the given statistics.
